			<section>Amogus is a fan-character out of the famous game "Among Us". He first appeared as a meme from a song called "Among us Drip" in which he stands in sneakers with crewmates standing next to him.
					 I know he's not officially called Amogus, that's just the name of the meme, but I always attached that name to him and it was a easier name then "red crewmate" and more distinct than just "red".</section>
