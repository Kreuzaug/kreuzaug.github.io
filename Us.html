			<section><p>I first met Amogus when I was browsing the internet one day and there was a video in my recommendation list. It was about Among us! My favorite game! I immediately watched the video which turned out to be a meme. I didn't think much of it at the time, it was just one meme of many, but something about it was always in the back of my head since that day.
					 I forgot about it after a few days but then my friend came to me with a meme he wanted to show. It was Amogus! I didn't know why, but I was kinda happy. I thought I just liked the meme, but there was something else. I began to play Among Us a lot more and always played the red crewmate. I began to listen to the "Among Us drip" remix a lot more often, most
					 of the time in the background when I used to listen to other music. My friends were getting kinda annoyed at me cause I kept playing "Among Us drip" in our discord. But I didn't care. I just listened in peace.
					 After that I started to get more attached to Amogus. I started downloading different pictures of him. Even printed out some pictures and putting them on my pinwall. He was more a friend to me at the time  but that began to change soon after.</p>

					 <p>Thanks Amogus.</p></section>
